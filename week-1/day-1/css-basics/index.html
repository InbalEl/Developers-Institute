    <h4>Exercise 3</h4>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>What is Lorem Ipsum?</li>
            <li>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, </li>
           <li>when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,</p>
        <ol>
            <li> remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets </li>
        </ol>
        <p> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
