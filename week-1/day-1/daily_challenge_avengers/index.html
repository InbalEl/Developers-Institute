                    <strong>T'Challa</strong> is the King of Wakanda and the eldest child of T'Chaka and Ramonda. As the Wakandan monarch, he became the holder of the Black Panther mantle.
                    Following the death of his father in a bombing, T'Challa had set out to kill the Winter Soldier. However, he eventually learned that another man was really the one responsible for the attack that killed his father.
                    As he captured the man who was responsible, he vowed never to allow desires of vengeance to consume him again.
